# Web-System
This project is a full-stack web application designed to allow users to search for universities across the world. Built using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), the system offers a seamless and secure experience for users looking to explore educational opportunities globally.
Key Features:
University Search: Users can search for universities worldwide based on various criteria.

User Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and securely manage their profiles.

Save and Manage Universities: Once logged in, users can save their selected universities and easily manage their saved list.

Personalised Experience: Registered users can return to the platform to review, update, or remove previously saved universities.

Security Implementation:
Security was a crucial aspect of this project. To ensure that user data is handled securely, I implemented the CryptoAPI for password encryption and authentication. This guarantees that user credentials are stored in a secure, encrypted format, safeguarding against unauthorised access. Additionally, the project follows best practices in web security, such as using secure session handling, form validation, and proper sanitisation to protect against SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

The combination of strong encryption, secure user authentication, and robust data handling ensures that user interactions with the platform are safe and protected from potential security threats.
